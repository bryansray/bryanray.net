## Hi there! ğŸ‘‹ 

I'm Bryan Ray. I'm an entrepreneur, software architect, development manager, technical lead, developer, designer, podcaster, video creator, husband, father, human and probably more. 

I have a proven track record of writing quality, usable software, building companies, mentoring teams, and leading projects to finished products on time and under budget. I understand the balance between business requirements, business development, and technical constraints. And understand how difficult it is to balance the two. 

I've spent a lot of time practicing and honing my craft. Learning how to turn businesses, ideas, and processes in to working software to be more efficient and/or effective.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Have questions? Shoot me a message and let's discuss. I'll compile a list of things I commonly get asked as time goes on.

##### What do you do when you're not programming?

I spend a lot of my extra time with my family or with my head in a book. I've compiled a list of books that I've enjoyed and continue to use as reference. These books have helped me grow tremendously both as a programmer, as a business person, and as a human being.
