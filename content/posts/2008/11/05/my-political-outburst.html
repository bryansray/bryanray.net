I'm typically not an outspoken person when it comes to politics. I don't particularly care for the drama of it all. Nor do I like how fired up people get over the whole thing. But there are times when people just say things that irritate me to no end.

To preface this, I am a Republican. But to be honest, I despise the stigma that comes along with either of the political parties. It seems like people in this country are starting to dislike people just because they're Democrat or Republican. Conservative or Liberal. Left or Right. Which is why I always stand in awe when I hear people brag about how "I hit them with the full Democratic ticket" or "I just voted for everything with an "R" next to it." Seriously? As if either party could possibly speak for you on every single issue on every single vote? That's pretty naive. Perhaps this has always been the case and I'm just now realizing it, but it just feels wrong to me.

It is **not** the Republican or Democratic party that makes this country great. It is having both parties to balance each other out. I agree with McCain on some of the issues and I agree with Obama on some of the issues. The only person who is going to agree with me 100% of the time on all the issues ... is me.

It shouldn't be hard to understand that one party goes off to do it's thing for 4 to 8 years and people get tired of it and they elect another party to go back the other way. It's a balancing act. Each party plays its role in this country and that is what empowers the **people**, not the government, to make this country the best country in the world.

The thing I keep hearing from Republicans is that "Obama is the Anti-Christ! He's going to totally destroy this country." Come on now. Get off it. I might not agree with a lot of Obama's policies. But the Anti-Christ? Hardly. Contrary to what rumors say â€¦ He's not going to drive this country in to the ground. He's not going to hand it over to terrorist on a silver platter. He's not going to start placing 666 on people and sacrificing chickens on an alter.

How do I know this? Because, regardless of who is in office, Republican or Democrat .. the American people are resilient. We're not as dumb as the media would have us believe. If we get attacked by some other country. You better believe that something in some foreign country is going to get blown up. That's what we do. That's what we're good at.

So ... to end this. I'm just going to say congratulations, Mr. Obama! Let's see what you can do!
