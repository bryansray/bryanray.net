I'm sitting here in Atlanta for MerbDay. We're currently in the first half of the conference; which is a live coding tutorial session. It's been pretty smooth so far for me, but a couple of my co-workers have had some issues with dependencies. Some strange params errors that are being spit out by ParseTree.

Anyways, this will be my first time presenting so I'm actually a bit nervous. I've got this bad preconceived notion that I'm just going to speed through the entire thing in less than 10 minutes. Although, I've been working on my presentation for some time now and I think I've got plenty of good examples and enough to fill up the 30 minutes that I've been allocated.

I'll try to make a post later with all the code and notes that I collect and a few links to anything of interest.
