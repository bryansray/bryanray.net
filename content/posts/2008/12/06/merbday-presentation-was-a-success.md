Well, I made it through my first presentation and I have to admit it was a lot easier than I had imagined it. My nerves were probably on edge, because the last time I presented in front of an audience was back in college when I was trying to slink my way through a presentation about social reform during the great depression … yeah, it was brutal. But I've learned that presenting is pretty easy when you're actually knowledgeable and passionate about what you're speaking on. Perhaps if I have kids some day I'll relay that little tidbit on to them!

I went through my slides a little faster than I wanted to, but I had about 10 minutes remaining and the audience had plenty of questions to ask; which filled up the rest of the time nicely. I also got some nice direction from Yehuda as well … which was very cool.

I'd like give a big thanks to everyone who came up and said hello before or after the conference as well. And for the support and feedback that I received after MerbDay. It was really comforting to hear that people were interested in the talk – even if you were just being nice; it gave me warm fuzzies. It was also really cool meeting some new people and getting to see some of the Merb developers face to face.

I think I'll definitely be sending in some more proposals for talks in the future. Now that I got my first one out of the way I think I could get comfortable speaking in front of an audience and hopefully get in to some other topics that I've always been interested in. Agile Conference 2009 in Chicago might be my next target … I'll keep you informed!

Anyhow … you can find my presentation on "The Merb Router In Depth":SlideShare at SlideShare as well as the small sample application I put together with a few obvious routes in the "MerbDay Atlanta Github":MerbDayGithub repository.

Again, it was awesome seeing and meeting everyone and I can't wait 'til the next Merb get together.
