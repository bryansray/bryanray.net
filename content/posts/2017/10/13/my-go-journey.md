Go has been a good experience. It is generally a very nice language, once you get used to it. I'd recommend that anyone curious about Golang to give it a try; in particular, you should really commit to persisting through the first 2 weeks, where you will most likely find some of Golang's ideologies challenging at first (like "why is every line an if statement?")

{{< highlight go >}}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world.")
}
