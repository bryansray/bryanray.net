Been on a bit of a reading spree this month and just wanted to share what I’m currently immersed in and what I have coming up on the list. I’m currently reading Catcher in the Rye by the late J.D. Salinger. I can’t remember the number of times I’ve read this book and I’m not entirely sure why I like it so much.

It’s a bit strange reading a book over so many years though. I remember reading it as a teenager and thinking that Holden was the coolest character ever. Then I remember reading it in my early to mid-twenties and thinking he was somewhat annoying. And now that I’m in my early thirties I’m pretty sure I despise Holden. He’s just so rebelious that it's frustrating; which is fine, but I think as you get older you just have a different opinion of him.

That’s what I’m currently reading and then there are a few on the next up list, including, but, not limited to: The Last Man (graphic novel), Presentation Zen, and Under the Dome. I’m still not sure which one I plan on reading, but I’ll figure it out soon enough. If you’ve got any suggestions I’d be more than happy to consider them.

Anyhow, just felt like putting down a few words while I’m at lunch just to keep up with my writing.
