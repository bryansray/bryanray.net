> You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else. - Albert Einstein

I had high hopes to actually write something with substance. But alas, time hath crept in on me, like a spiteful theif in the night. It hath stolen my desires, my awakedness and left a poisoned dagger in my mind. Coated with dreams, I fret. I shall strive hard to do better in the morrow.

I had a good day. I really enjoy the people I work with. I enjoy the technologies I work with. I'm so thankful for my family, my friends, and my profession. It's nice to be around good people. I wish there was more I could do to make more people happy or less stressed. I wish I could help more of my co-workers. I need more time in the day â€¦ I need more day in my time.

I need more ...
