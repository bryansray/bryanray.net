> Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated. - Confucius

I keep procrastinating my writing until 11:00 PM and by that time my brain has fully shut down. So here I sit again, dear reader, just babbling away in to the keyboard. Nothing really valuable to add to my site other than things I'm currently doing or tinkering with.

I started to tinker with NodeJS over the past 5-6 months based on a recommendation from my buddy, [Curtis](http://curtis.schlak.com/). He convinced me of its usefulness. And while I had never been a fan of javascript as a language, I have to admit that the more time I spend with it, the more I like it. I'm sure any one will admit that it has it's quirks, but ultimately, it's a pretty cool language, once you get to know it.

NodeJS, is one of those simple ideas that is really executed well and serves its purpose beautifully. Typically, things in Node just work (tm). Node, in general, has helped me step my javascript game up. That's one of the things I find so great about Node, is that all the work you do on the back-end, can be translated over to the front-end in your day-to-day job.

Anyhow, some of the front-end javascript libraries that I've been using for my Node side project: [Huddle](https://github.com/bryansray/Huddle) are: [momentjs](http://momentjs.com/docs/), amplify, crossroads, handlebars, [lodash](http://lodash.com/), require, and signals. And some of the back-end libraries for Node are: express, jade, marked, moment, socket.io, stork and mongoose.
