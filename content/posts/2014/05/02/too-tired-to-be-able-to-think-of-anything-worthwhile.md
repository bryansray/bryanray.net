**Day 2 of 31**: I've literally been sitting at the computer for the past 30 to 45 minutes debating what to write about. I've been awake since 4:30 AM and, unfortunately, I just can't come up with anything relevant to write.

I've been catching up on the [House of Cards](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010/) series. It's incredibly intriguing and has managed to keep my attention very well. I'm just about to wrap up Season 1.

Well, I needed to get some typing done for today, because I wasn't going to miss a day due to my silly tired brain. Let's hope my buddy [Curtis](http://curtis.schlak.com/) makes his post better than this silly one.
