> Never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people - your family, friends, and coworkers, and even strangers you meet along the way.

Today I met a sales woman named, Logan. I'm not sure why I feel compelled to talk about Logan, but I do. Logan was friendly. Logan had a great personality. Or at least it was highly compatible with mine. Our personalities instantly worked well together.

Logan was a pleasant part of my day and it made me happy to be able to connect with random strangers, like her, from time to time. On the other hand, I also find it sad that communicating with people and having a real conversation is generally frowned upon. I should take it upon myself to try and have meaningful conversations with more people.

In my youth, I used to think that I disliked everyone. I can remember thinking to myself that, "90% of the people that I come I come in contact with on a day-to-day basis have no idea what they're talking about." I still think that might be pretty accurate advice, but as I've grown older I've also learned that it is better to give people the benefit of the doubt.

As I've grown older, and hopefully wiser, I've also started to realize that I generally like people. The difficult part about dealing with other people, I've found, is trying to understand what they want. Some people are pretty simple. While others are much more complicated. Some are open books. Whilst others are mathematical formulas. Some are flexible, others just seem as though they won't budge at all.

I always like to adapt to others personalities. I like to find a ways to connect with people.

Another thing that I've always been fascinated by, is human psychology. I love to understand why we humans do what we do. The subconcious is so intriguing to me. I find it so interesting that at some level, I am persuaded on a daily basis by things that I *think* I have no interest in. Things such as fonts, logos, colors, and possibly even seeing some commercial on the televisions in passing that might influence my decisions months down the road.

All that being said, I've really started to think how lucky I am to be surrounded by such **great** people. I truly appreciate every person I work with. I value their input. I value their time they put in to their work. Even if it is unrelated to what I'm doing. I hope that I can absorb at least a small bit of good from every person I encounter in order to better myself.
